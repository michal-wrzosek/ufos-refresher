### Simple way to stay up to date with latest UFO news

If you find it difficult to keep track of all the UFO news on reddit, this website can be helpful. It loads reddit "hot" from r/UFOs and show you only the posts that you haven't seen yet.

**The website does not use any cookies. There're no ads. Hosting is free thanks to Netlify.**

In order to show you only the posts you haven't seen yet, the website is storing IDs of posts you've already seen in your browser's Local Storage, so you don't have to log in. The only downside is that this website will store what you've seen on the device you use, so you can't sync things you've seen between your computer and mobile.
